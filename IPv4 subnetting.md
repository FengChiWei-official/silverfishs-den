## subnet analysis

how many do I need to allocate to the subnet?
- how many **host** do you have
	- do you consider the **router**?
- you should consider [[reserved-ip|2 reserved ips]]
## FLSM(with subnet mask)
### process
1. do **subnet analysis**
2. decide on the **subnet id** bit length
3. decide on the **host id**

## VLSM(with mask)
### process
1. do subnet analysis
2. range subnet by length of them
3. allocate subnet id for them
