**LimiX** (Chinese: **极数**) is the world's first **Large Data Model (LDM)** for structured data, officially open-sourced in **August 2025** by Professor Cui Peng's team at **Tsinghua University** in collaboration with **Stable & Accurate AI**.

Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) that focus on text, LimiX is designed specifically to handle **structured data** (tables, time series, and graphs) with a core emphasis on **Causal Intelligence**.

Key Features and Technical Breakthroughs

- **Universal Structured Data Processing:** LimiX treats structured data as a joint distribution of variables, enabling it to handle diverse data formats without task-specific fine-tuning.
- **Causal Discovery & Inference:** Unlike models that only capture statistical correlations, LimiX is pre-trained on causal synthetic data, allowing it to identify "cause-and-effect" relationships and perform **counterfactual reasoning**.
- **Zero-Shot Versatility:** It serves as a "plug-and-play" solution for over 10 types of tasks, including classification, regression, missing value imputation, and data generation.
- **Robustness against Data Noise:** By employing a triple-masking mechanism (at the sample, feature, and semantic levels), LimiX maintains high accuracy even in scenarios with significant missing data or distribution shifts.

Industry Impact

LimiX is primarily targeted at **industrial sectors** (such as smart manufacturing, energy, and finance) where structured data is dominant. It aims to lower the barrier for AI adoption in vertical industries by solving complex causal problems that traditional machine learning models struggle to address.
