[704. Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)
## Text
Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
## Thoughts

you are supposed to follow [[Loop Invariant Principle]],.

1. For `Open Interal`($[l, r]$): the case $[a,a]$ is valid Search Space.
> 	you have no need to check if check it for couple times.

	so you use `while (left <= right)`
	
2. For `half-open Interal`($[l,r]$): the case $[a,a]$ is invalid.

	so you use `while (left <= right)`
