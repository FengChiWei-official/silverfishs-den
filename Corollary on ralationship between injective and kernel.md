## Let
- $\phi: \mathbf{G} \to \mathbf{G^{\prime}}$
- $K$ is the kernel of $\phi$

## conclusion
$$ 
\phi \text{ is injective } \iff \mathbf{K} = {1_G}
$$

## proof
### if $\mathbf{K} = 1_G$
[[Theorem on kernel of Homomorphism]] shows that $\phi(a) = \phi(b) \iff a^{-1}b \in (\mathbf{K} =\{1\})$
so, $\forall a, b \in \mathbf{G}, \phi(a) = \phi(b) \text{ then } a = b, \text{ if } \mathbf{K} = 1_G$

## only if $\mathbf{K} = 1_G$
because of the $\phi$ is injective, so there are only $\phi(1_G) = 1_{G^{\prime}}$
based on define of Kernel, we know $\mathbf{K} = \{1\}$
