# define
based on [[The Cyclic Decomposition Theorem for Subgroups of Addition Group|the theorem]], we can know that subgroup of [[Addition Group]] shares the common form $\mathbf{Z}a$.
## related theorem
1. [[The Cyclic Decomposition Theorem for Subgroups of Addition Group]]
2. it is [[Cyclic Group]]

## other form
- $\mathbf{Z}a +\mathbf{Z}b$: [[Subgroup of Addition Group(generated by a and b)]]
- $\mathbf{Z}a \cap \mathbf{Z}b$: [[Subgroup of Addition Group(generated by a times b)]]
