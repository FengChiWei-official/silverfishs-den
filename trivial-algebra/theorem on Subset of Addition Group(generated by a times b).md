## preparation
Let:
- $a , b \in \mathbf{Z}^+, \text{ and } a, b \ne 0$
- $m$ is the $\text{lcm}$ of $a$ and $b$
- $\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{Z}a \cap \mathbf{Z}b = \mathbf{Z}m$

## define
1. $m$ is divisible by both $a$ and $b$
2. if an integer $n$ is divisible by $a$ and $b$, then it is divisible by $m$

## proof
that is trivial,
