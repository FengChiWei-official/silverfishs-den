#algo 
## recognition

  

if you see a problem like that:

$$ result = op^{d}(x) $$

$d$ is a int. so d can be seperated into n-based digits, for a example, $7 = [1, 1, 1]_2$.

  

form the point of view of **algebra**, we can say that that is a calculation for a operation(with **associativity** and **identity**)'s exponentiation(and calculate for several times).

  

## what can it do?

  

it makes calculation efficiently.form $O(n) = n \to O(n) = log(n)$
