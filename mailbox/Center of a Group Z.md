## define
- $Z$ is a **subgroup**
- $\mathbf{Z} = \{z \in \mathbf{G} \mid zx = xz, \forall x \in \mathbf{G}\}$
## how to understand?
$\mathbf{Z}$ are the elements that good to **communiate** with others, so that they can 左右逢源？

I believe that it is something seems like [[Manifold]]. In this local area, we can see $\mathbf{G}$ as a [[Abelian Group]]

## attribute 
center is always the [[Normal Subgroup]]
