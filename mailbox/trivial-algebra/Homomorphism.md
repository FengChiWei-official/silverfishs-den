## define 
[[define of Homomprphism]]

## Property
[[Properties of Homomorphism]]

## Theorem
[[Theorem on kernel of Homomorphism]]
## generated important subgroup
[[Image of Homomorphism]]
[[Kernel of Homomorphism]]

## related
### [[Functor]]:
they are both arguing an relationship similar to [[Orthogonal]]
### usage
based on [[Image of Homomorphism|Image]], we defined what is [[Class]]--[[Coset]] who shares the **same Image**, and the [[Kernel of Homomorphism|Kernel]] tell us [[Coset|how to get the Coset]].
