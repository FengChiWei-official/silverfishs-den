[33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
## technique

Other than [[Binary Search]], we CAN:
1. find that there are **2** increasing parts. Left one is greater than right one.
	1. you can tell which part a integer belongs to, by comparing with `nums[0]`.
2. there are **just** 2 parts,
	1. when `m` separates `nums` into 2 parts, at least one part is **increasing**.
